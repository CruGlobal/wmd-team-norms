Team Inbox Instructions
==================

The main point of the team inbox is to provide help desk and tool owners a single place they can send requests rather than emailing individual programmers directly. Each member of the team is responsible for monitoring the inbox one day/week. 

Guidelines for managing the inbox on your day
------------------
* Check the inbox several times over the course of the day.
* Respond to any issues you're able to respond to.
* If there's an email none of the people assigned to the inbox that day can answer, add a label for someone who you think could handle it, and forward it to that person.
* Archive emails that you reply to, or emails that don't require a response.
* *Do NOT* archive emails that you have forwarded to another developer. 

The inbox should always contain any email that is waiting for a programmer to reply to.
