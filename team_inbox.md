Team Inbox Instructions
==================

The main point of the team inbox is to provide help desk and tool owners a single place they can send requests rather than emailing individual programmers directly. Each member of the team is responsible for monitoring the inbox one day/week. 

Guidelines for managing the inbox on your day
------------------
* Check the inbox several times over the course of the day.
* Respond to any issues you're able to respond to.  A 24 hour initial response time is the expected timeframe.  That doesn't mean that the issue/enhancement is required to be completed in 24 hours, just an initial response.
* If there's an email none of the people assigned to the inbox that day can answer, add a label for someone who you think could handle it, and forward it to that person.
* Archive emails that you reply to, or emails that don't require a response.
* *Do NOT* archive emails that you have forwarded to another developer. 
* If you know you will be out for an assigned inbox day, please coordinate with someone else on the team to monitor the inbox in your place so the load doesn't fall all on one person, or if two people are out, the inbox go unwatched.

The inbox should always contain any email that is waiting for a programmer to reply to.
