* Any time everyone on the team has green for the week, we'll celebrate with team lunch the following week, usually on tuesday (remote people will have to order their own food). 
* The sub-team with the highest score at the end of the day Thursday will get Friday as their 20% day. If both sub-teams are yellow, we all get the 20% day.
